# Machine Learning Adventures

Hello! This is a collection of experiments, re-implmentations, and fun things I have done in machine learning. All of the code will be written in Python and I commonly use the libraries numpy, keras, and pytorch

## Folders

Each of the folders contains the code for creating a deep learning model for that dataset. All the files should have comments explaning the overall thought process. I plan on attatching accuracies and graphs later on.

## Current Folders

 - **kddcup1999** - A cybersecurity dataset which can be found [here](https://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html)
 - **wisdm** - A human activity dataset which can be found [here](http://www.cis.fordham.edu/wisdm/dataset.php)
